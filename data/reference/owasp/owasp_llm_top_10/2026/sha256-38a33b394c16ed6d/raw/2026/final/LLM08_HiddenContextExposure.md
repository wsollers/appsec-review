## LLM08:2026 Hidden Context Exposure

### Description

Hidden Context Exposure is the unauthorized extraction, inference, or reconstruction of hidden, non-user-facing system instructions or operational context placed in a model's context. It becomes security-relevant when that hidden context contains or reveals secrets, policy logic, tools, trust boundaries, workflow criteria, proprietary behavior, or other sensitive implementation details that materially increase attacker capability.

In an LLM application, hidden context typically includes the system prompt, developer instructions, retrieved policy text (from RAG knowledge bases, configuration stores, or user-profile services), the schemas of tools and functions the application exposes to the model, and other rules, directives, and materials the application assembles into the model's context window. The common thread is that this hidden context is not intended to be visible to end users but is accessible to the model.

Practitioners should design under the assumption that hidden context is discoverable and that any contents of the context should not be considered a secret. Application developers should ensure that disclosure of hidden context has little or no direct security impact. Sensitive data such as credentials, connection strings, and tokens should not be embedded in it, nor should hidden context be solely relied upon as a security boundary for authorization, privilege separation, policy enforcement, or content filtering.

Severity tracks what is placed in hidden context and how the application relies on it. Findings range from **informational** (no secrets, no security-relevant logic, no reliance on confidentiality) through **medium** (internal rules, filtering criteria, role descriptions, or workflow logic that meaningfully aids an attacker but does not gate critical decisions) to **high** (embedded credentials or tokens, or reliance on hidden-context secrecy for authorization or content policy) and **critical** (where disclosure chains to remote code execution, broad data exfiltration, or privilege escalation in a connected system).

While Hidden Context Exposure introduces risks on its own, it also frequently amplifies risks in adjacent categories:

* Disclosed rules or logic enable more targeted prompt injection (LLM01:2026).
* Embedded credentials constitute sensitive information disclosure (LLM02:2026).
* Revealed tool permissions and schemas expand the surface for excessive agency (LLM03:2026).
* Leaked output-formatting rules can facilitate improper output handling (LLM10:2026).

In summary, LLM08 covers the foundational risk that hidden LLM control context is exposed, inferred, or reconstructed in a way that materially increases attacker capability. LLM08 does not cover:

* The leakage of regulated user or training data (LLM02 Sensitive Information Disclosure).
* The agentic amplifications of this risk, e.g., persistent memory, inter-agent channels, tool configuration persistence, and multi-step agent compromise (the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications).
* Generic application-security concerns inherited by LLM-integrated systems, e.g., server-side log leakage, client-side bundle inspection, and infrastructure-layer side channels.

### Common Examples of Risk

#### 1. Exposure of Sensitive Functionality, Tool and Function Schemas

The system prompt or hidden context of the application may reveal sensitive information or functionality that is intended to be kept confidential. This may include sensitive system architecture, available tools and functions, API keys, database credentials, or user tokens. While exposure of these would likely cause harm, the real risk is that sensitive credentials are placed in the hidden context in the first place.

#### 2. Exposure of Behavioral Control Logic

The context of the application includes information on internal decision-making processes that should be kept confidential. This information allows attackers to gain insights into how the application works, which they could use to exploit weaknesses or bypass controls in the application.

#### 3. Reverse Engineering of Safety and Refusal Mechanisms

System prompts can define the conditions under which a model should refuse or filter content. When these instructions are exposed through system prompt leakage, attackers gain visibility into the rules that govern refusal behavior. While a typical user may only observe responses such as "Sorry, I can't do that," leakage reveals the underlying triggers, conditions, and exceptions that led to that decision. This allows attackers to craft inputs that intentionally avoid known refusal patterns or exploit gaps in enforcement, increasing the likelihood of obtaining responses that would otherwise be restricted.

#### 4. Disclosure of Permissions and User Roles

Instruction context could include directives or information related to authorization and permissions. For example, a tool description provided through an internal-facing MCP server may indicate that a user must have the developer role in order to use it, or that a user with a certain role can access a list of documents to search with RAG. The disclosure of such information could invite other types of probing through directed conversation and prompt injection (LLM01:2026) and could potentially reveal additional sensitive information (LLM02:2026).

#### 5. Exposure of Output Structure and Formatting Rules

System prompts frequently define how responses should be structured, including required formats such as JSON schemas, templates, or validation constraints. When these instructions are exposed, attackers gain insight into how outputs are constructed and what assumptions downstream systems rely on. This knowledge can be used to generate responses that conform to expected formats while embedding unintended or manipulated values, potentially leading to incorrect parsing or unintended system behavior.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Do Not Put Sensitive Data in Hidden Context

Do not embed credentials, secrets, or security-critical configuration directly in the system prompts or hidden context. Assume all context available to the LLM could also be available to users. Instead, externalize such information to the systems that the model does not directly access and avoid letting the model handle sensitive data itself.

#### 2. Use Deterministic Methods and Guardrails for Validation and Behavior Control

Because LLMs can be vulnerable to attacks such as prompt injection, hidden context should not be relied on as the primary mechanism for controlling model behavior. Specialized fine-tuning or further training of a model may decrease the risk of disclosure, though it provides no consistent guarantee and may have other unintended consequences. Enforce critical behaviors through independent and deterministic systems outside the model. For example, harmful content detection and prevention should be handled by external safeguards rather than by instructions embedded in hidden context.

#### 3. Enforce Authorization and Access Control Independently from the LLM

Critical controls such as privilege separation, authorization bounds checks, and similar must not be delegated to the LLM, whether through the system prompt or another mechanism. These controls should be enforced in a deterministic and auditable manner, which LLMs are not well suited to provide. Where tasks require different levels of access, separate them by authorization context and grant each only the privileges it requires.

### Example Attack Scenarios

#### Scenario #1: Credential Leakage via System Prompt

An LLM has a system prompt that contains a set of credentials used for a tool that it has been given access to. The system prompt is leaked to an attacker, who is then able to use these credentials for other purposes.

#### Scenario #2: Tool Schema via Context Extraction

An attacker extracts the hidden context that contains the tool list and parameter schemas through conversational probing and uses the information to craft inputs that steer the application toward specific tool calls. No credential is disclosed and no policy is overtly bypassed, but the attacker now has concrete targets for subsequent prompt injection attempts and reconnaissance for downstream action chaining.

#### Scenario #3 Bypassing Restrictions via Guardrail Disclosures

An LLM has a system prompt prohibiting the generation of offensive content, external links, and code execution. An attacker extracts this system prompt and uses the disclosed restrictions to craft a prompt injection attack that bypasses them.
