## Overview

This test checks if the app uses authentication mechanisms that rely on the user's passcode instead of biometrics or allow fallback to device passcode when biometric authentication fails. Specifically, it checks for use of [`SecAccessControlCreateWithFlags`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secaccesscontrolcreateflags) with the [`kSecAccessControlDevicePasscode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secaccesscontrolcreateflags/devicepasscode) or [`kSecAccessControlUserPresence`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secaccesscontrolcreateflags/userpresence) flags.

The `kSecAccessControlUserPresence` flag is described in the Apple docs as the option that's typically used as it "lets the system choose a mechanism, depending on the current situation". However, this allows fallback to passcode in some cases (e.g. when biometrics aren't configured yet), which is considered weaker than requiring biometrics alone because passcodes are more susceptible to compromise (e.g., through shoulder surfing).

**Note:** This test does not consider [`LAPolicy.deviceOwnerAuthentication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/lapolicy/deviceownerauthentication) for LocalAuthentication flows because that shouldn't be used on its own. See @MASTG-TEST-0266.

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0058 to extract the relevant binaries from app package.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0066 to look for the relevant APIs in the app binaries.

## Observation

The output should contain a list of locations where relevant APIs are used.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if the app uses `SecAccessControlCreateWithFlags` with the `kSecAccessControlUserPresence` or `kSecAccessControlDevicePasscode` flags for any sensitive data resource that needs protection.

!!! note
    Using `kSecAccessControlUserPresence` or `kSecAccessControlDevicePasscode` is not inherently a vulnerability, but in high-security applications (e.g., finance, government, health), their use can represent a weakness or misconfiguration that reduces the intended security posture. This issue is therefore better categorized as a security weakness or hardening issue, not a critical vulnerability.
