## Overview

This test is the dynamic counterpart to @MASTG-TEST-0297.

In this test, device logs are monitored, captured, and analyzed for sensitive data.

!!! warning Limitation
    - Linking the logs back to specific locations in the app can be difficult and requires manual analysis of the code. As an alternative you can use @MASTG-TECH-0095.
    - Dynamic analysis works best when you interact extensively with the app. But even then there could be corner cases which are difficult or impossible to execute on every device. The results from this test therefore are likely not exhaustive.

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0056 to install the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0060 to monitor the device logs.
3. Open the app.
4. Navigate to the screens you want to analyze the log output from.
5. Close the app.

## Observation

The output should contain the logged data captured during runtime.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if sensitive data can be found in the output.
