## Overview

This test checks whether the Android app ensures the Security Provider is [updated to mitigate SSL/TLS vulnerabilities](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-gms-provider). The provider should be updated using Google Play Services APIs, and the implementation should handle exceptions properly.

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0013 to reverse engineer the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0014 to look for the relevant APIs.

## Observation

The output should list all locations where the Security Provider update is performed and how exceptions are handled (for `installIfNeeded`), or how the `ProviderInstallListener` handles errors (for `installIfNeededAsync`).

## Evaluation

The test case fails if the app does not update the provider, or it does not handle exceptions properly. Check that these calls occur before any network connections are made.
