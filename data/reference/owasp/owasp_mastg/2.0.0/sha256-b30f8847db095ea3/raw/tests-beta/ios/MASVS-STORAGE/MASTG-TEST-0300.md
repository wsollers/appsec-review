## Overview

This test checks whether the app writes unencrypted sensitive data to private storage. It focuses on:

- APIs that persist data in the app sandbox directories, including Foundation `FileManager` methods, low-level POSIX and BSD file I/O calls and high-level APIs such as `UserDefaults`, Core Data and SQLite wrappers.
- Keychain APIs used to:
    - store sensitive data directly within the Keychain
    - manage keys from the Keychain (that could be used to encrypt data before writing to private storage).

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0058 to extract the relevant binaries from app package.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0066 to look for the relevant APIs in the app binaries.

## Observation

The output should contain:

- A list of locations where the app writes or may write data to private storage.
- A list of locations where the app uses Keychain APIs, including access control and accessibility attributes.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if the sensitive data is not encrypted before being written to private storage or the Keychain API isn't used to store the sensitive data.
