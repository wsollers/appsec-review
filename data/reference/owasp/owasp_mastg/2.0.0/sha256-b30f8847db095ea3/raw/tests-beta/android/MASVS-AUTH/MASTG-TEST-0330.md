## Overview

This test checks if the app configures cryptographic keys with an extended validity duration that allows keys to remain unlocked beyond the immediate operation. When using biometric authentication with [`CryptoObject`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/biometric/BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject), the authentication validity duration determines how long a key remains usable after successful authentication.

On Android, developers can configure this behavior using [`setUserAuthenticationParameters(int timeout, int type)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder#setUserAuthenticationParameters(int,%20int)) or the deprecated [`setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(int)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder#setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(int)) when generating keys with [`KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder):

- **Duration = 0**: The key requires authentication for every cryptographic operation. This is the most secure configuration as each use of the key requires biometric verification.
- **Duration > 0**: The key remains unlocked for the specified duration (in seconds) after successful authentication. When the duration is set to a high value in the range of minutes or hours an attacker with physical access to the phone could trigger sensitive operations without biometric verification.

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0013 to reverse engineer the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0014 to look for the relevant APIs.

## Observation

The output should include a list of locations where the relevant APIs are used.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if the app configures keys used for sensitive operations with:

- `setUserAuthenticationParameters(duration, type)` where duration > 0
- `setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(duration)` where duration > 0

!!! note
    A non-zero authentication validity duration is not inherently a vulnerability. Short durations in the range of seconds may be acceptable for certain use cases where multiple related operations need to be performed in quick succession. However, for high-security applications and sensitive operations, requiring authentication per use (duration = 0) provides the strongest protection against unauthorized key usage and runtime attacks.
