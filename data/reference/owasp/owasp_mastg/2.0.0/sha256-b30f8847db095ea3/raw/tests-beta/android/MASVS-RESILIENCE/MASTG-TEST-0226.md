## Overview

This test case checks if the app has the `debuggable` flag ([`android:debuggable`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#debug)) set to `true` in the `AndroidManifest.xml`. When this flag is enabled, it allows the app to be debugged enabling attackers to inspect the app's internals, bypass security controls, or manipulate runtime behavior.

Although having the `debuggable` flag set to `true` [is not considered a direct vulnerability](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/android-debuggable), it significantly increases the attack surface by providing unauthorized access to app data and resources, particularly in production environments.

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0117 to obtain the AndroidManifest.xml.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0150 to obtain the `debuggable` flag.

## Observation

The output should explicitly show whether the `debuggable` flag is set (`true` or `false`). If the flag is not specified, it is treated as `false` by default for release builds.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if the `debuggable` flag is explicitly set to `true`. This indicates that the app is configured to allow debugging, which is inappropriate for production environments.
