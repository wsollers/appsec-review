## Overview

This test checks for references to Content Provider access in WebViews, which is enabled by default and can be disabled using the `setAllowContentAccess` method in the `WebSettings` class. If improperly configured, this can introduce security risks such as unauthorized file access and data exfiltration.

The JavaScript code would have access to any content providers on the device, such as:

- declared by the app, **even if they are not exported**.
- declared by other apps, **only if they are exported** and if they are not following recommended [best practices](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-tips#content-providers) to restrict access.

Refer to @MASTG-KNOW-0018 for more information on the `setAllowContentAccess` method, the specific files that can be accessed, and the conditions under which they can be accessed.

**Note 1:** We do not consider `minSdkVersion` since `setAllowContentAccess` defaults to `true` regardless of the Android version.

**Note 2:** The provider's `android:grantUriPermissions` attribute is irrelevant in this scenario as it does not affect the app itself accessing its own content providers. It allows **other apps** to temporarily access URIs from the provider even though restrictions such as `permission` attributes, or `android:exported="false"` are set. Also, if the app uses a `FileProvider`, the `android:grantUriPermissions` attribute must be set to `true` by [definition](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/content/FileProvider#:~:text=Set%20the%20android:grantUriPermissions%20attribute%20to%20true%2C%20to%20allow%20you%20to%20grant%20temporary%20access%20to%20files.%20) (otherwise you'll get a `SecurityException: Provider must grant uri permissions"`).

**Note 3:** `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` is critical in the attack since it relaxes the default restrictions, allowing pages loaded from `file://` to access content from any origin, including `content://` URIs.

If this setting is not enabled, the following error will appear in `logcat`:

```text
[INFO:CONSOLE(0)] "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'content://org.owasp.mastestapp.provider/sensitive.txt'
from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross origin requests are only supported
for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, https, chrome-untrusted.", source: file:/// (0)
```

While the `fetch` request to the external server would still work, retrieving the file content via `content://` would fail.

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0013 to reverse engineer the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0014 to look for the relevant APIs.
3. Use @MASTG-TECH-0117 to obtain the AndroidManifest.xml.
4. Use @MASTG-TECH-0150 to obtain the list of content providers declared in the app's AndroidManifest.xml file.

## Observation

The output should contain:

- A list of WebView instances, including the following methods and their arguments:
    - `setAllowContentAccess`
    - `setJavaScriptEnabled`
    - `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs`
- A list of content providers declared in the app's AndroidManifest.xml file.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if all the following applies:

- `setJavaScriptEnabled` is explicitly set to `true`.
- `setAllowContentAccess` is explicitly set to `true` or _not used at all_ (inheriting the default value, `true`).
- `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` method is explicitly set to `true`.

You should use the list of content providers obtained in the observation step to verify if they handle sensitive data.

!!! note
    The `setAllowContentAccess` method being set to `true` does not represent a security vulnerability by itself, but it can be used in combination with other vulnerabilities to escalate the impact of an attack.
