## Overview

This test checks if the app implements event-bound biometric authentication (@MASTG-KNOW-0001) to access sensitive resources (e.g., tokens, keys), where authentication success relies solely on a callback result rather than being cryptographically bound to sensitive operations and requiring user presence.

On Android, `BiometricPrompt.authenticate()` can be called [with a `CryptoObject`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt#authenticate(android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject,%20android.os.CancellationSignal,%20java.util.concurrent.Executor,%20android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback)) or [without a `CryptoObject`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt#authenticate(android.os.CancellationSignal,%20java.util.concurrent.Executor,%20android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback)). When used **without a `CryptoObject`** the app relies on the [`onAuthenticationSucceeded`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback#onAuthenticationSucceeded(android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult)) callback to determine if authentication was successful (event-bound). This makes it susceptible to logic manipulation by overwriting the callback without successfully passing the biometric verification.

In contrast, when a `CryptoObject` is used (crypto-bound), the app passes a cryptographic object (e.g., `Cipher`, `Signature`, `Mac`) that requires user authentication. This ensures authentication is not just a one-time boolean, but part of a secure data retrieval path (out-of-process), so bypassing authentication becomes significantly harder.

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0013 to reverse engineer the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0014 to look for the relevant APIs.

## Observation

The output should include a list of locations where the relevant APIs are used.

## Evaluation

The test case fails for each sensitive operation worth protecting if all of the following applies:

- `BiometricPrompt.authenticate` is used [without a `CryptoObject`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt#authenticate(android.os.CancellationSignal,%20java.util.concurrent.Executor,%20android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback)).
- There are no calls to key generation with `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)` in conjunction with biometric authentication, as by default, the key is authorized to be used regardless of whether the user has been authenticated or not.
