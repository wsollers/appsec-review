note: This test checks if the app uses the default SQLite API (e.g., `SQLiteOpenHelper`, `context.openOrCreateDatabase`) to store sensitive data (e.g., tokens, PII) in an unencrypted database file within the app's sandbox. It confirms the absence of secure alternatives like SQLCipher or encrypted databases.
