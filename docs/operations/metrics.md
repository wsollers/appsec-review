# Review metrics

Run `appsec-review metrics --run-id <id>` after or during a review. The command deterministically
rebuilds `runs/<run-id>/data/telemetry/summary.json` and prints the same document. It does not scan
the target repository. All review-scope values resolve through receipt paths and SHA-256 identities
recorded in the run telemetry stream.

Use `review.source_by_language`, `review.projects`, `review.build_units`, and `review.artifacts` for
scope and throughput. Artifact `reference_*` values answer how much work build units reference;
`deduplicated_*` values answer how many distinct content objects were produced. Do not substitute
one for the other when artifacts are shared.

Use `review.codeql_timings.groups` for like-for-like scope comparisons and the `aggregate`,
`by_language`, `by_project`, and `by_profile` views for rollups. `summed_work_ms` includes concurrent
producer work; `wall_span_ms` merges overlapping intervals. Reused checkpoints are visible as
reused work with zero elapsed producer duration.

Treat every entry in `review.gaps`, every nonzero `source_gap_count`, and every build or CodeQL gap
as missing coverage. A missing, changed, escaped, or malformed receipt is an integrity gap and is
never evidence that the corresponding scope is clean. `finding_states` counts only authoritative
finding transitions; scanner observations and CodeQL SARIF result counts are not confirmed defects
or vulnerabilities.
